                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-sm-row justify-content-between py-2 my-2 border-top border-success" id="story-line"></div>
                <p>Our journey began with a shared passion for sustainability and creativity. Every year, households and industries generate vast amounts of waste, much of which ends up in landfills, harming the environment. We saw an opportunity to not only reduce waste but also empower artists and innovators to turn these discarded materials into beautiful and functional products.
                Thus, our platform was bornâ€”a place where waste finds new life, and people find inspiration.</p>
